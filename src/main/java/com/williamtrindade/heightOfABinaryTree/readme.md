## Tree: Height of a Binary Tree
The height of a binary tree is the number of edges between the tree's root and its furthest leaf. For example, the following binary tree is of height 2:

### Function Description

Complete the getHeight or height function in the editor. It must return the height of a binary tree as an integer.

getHeight or height has the following parameter(s):

- root: a reference to the root of a binary tree.  
Note -The Height of binary tree with single node is taken as zero.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer n, the number of nodes in the tree.
Next line contains n space separated integer where ith integer denotes node[i].data.

Note: Node values are inserted into a binary search tree before a reference to the tree's root node is passed to your function. In a binary search tree, all nodes on the left branch of a node are less than the node value. All values on the right branch are greater than the node value.

### Constraints
1 <= node.data[i] <= 20
1 <= n <= 20

### Output Format
Your function should return a single integer denoting the height of the binary tree.

#### Sample Input

![2.png](2.png)

#### Sample Output

> 3

#### Explanation
The longest root-to-leaf path is shown below:  

![3.png](3.png)


There are 4 nodes in this path that are connected by 3 edges, 
meaning our binary tree's height = 3.
