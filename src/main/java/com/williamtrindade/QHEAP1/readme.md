This question is designed to help you get a better understanding of basic heap operations.

There are **3** types of query:

* `"1 "`*v* - Add an element *v* to the heap.
* `"2 "`*v* - Delete the element *v* from the heap.
* `"3"` - Print the minimum of all the elements in the heap.

**NOTE**: It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap. Also, at any instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the number of queries, *Q*.

Each of the next *Q* lines contains one of the **3** types of query.

**Constraints**

$1 \le Q \le 10^5$

$-10^9 \le v \le 10^9$

**Output Format**

For each query of type **3**, print the minimum value on a single line.

**Sample Input**

```text
STDIN       Function
-----       --------
5           Q = 5
1 4         insert 4
1 9         insert 9
3           print minimum
2 4         delete 4
3           print minimum
```

**Sample Output**

```text
4
9
```

**Explanation**

After the first **2** queries, the heap contains {**4**, **9**}. Printing the minimum gives **4** as the output. Then, the **4**<sup>th</sup> query deletes **4** from the heap, and the **5**<sup>th</sup> query gives **9** as the output.
